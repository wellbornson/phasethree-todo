# Specification Quality Checklist: AI-Powered Todo Chatbot

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-29
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) in *User Scenarios*
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders (mostly)
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (mostly, barring user-mandated stack)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification (Exceptions made for User-mandated constraints)

## Notes

- User explicitly requested technical stack details in the spec ("Full Specs... Tech Stack..."). Included these as "Technical Constraints" to separate them from functional behavior.
